## Architecture Overview

### Event-Driven Architecture
CardSharp uses a phased modernization architecture with these key components:

1. **Event System** - Core components communicate through events
   - `EventEmitter` in `cardsharp/events/emitter.py` - Handles event pub/sub
   - All state changes emit events for decoupling and verification
   - Supports both sync and async event handlers

2. **Adapters** - Platform-specific code isolated in adapters
   - `PlatformAdapter` interface in `cardsharp/adapters/base.py`
   - Implementations: CLI, Web, Dummy (for testing)
   - Handles rendering and user input for different platforms

3. **Immutable State** - Game state transitions via pure functions
   - State models in `cardsharp/state/models.py`
   - Transition functions in `cardsharp/state/transitions.py`
   - State is never mutated, only new states created

4. **Game Engines** - Core game logic
   - Base engine in `cardsharp/engine/base.py`
   - Game-specific engines (Blackjack, War, High Card, Durak)
   - Engines emit events and manage state transitions

5. **APIs** - High-level interfaces
   - Async APIs in `cardsharp/api/` for each game
   - Support both sync and async operation modes
   - Event-driven flow control

### Key Design Patterns

- **State Pattern**: Game flow managed through state transitions
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different playing strategies (Basic, Counting, Aggressive, Martingale)
- **Observer Pattern**: Event system for decoupled communication
- **Adapter Pattern**: Platform-specific rendering and input handling

### Performance Considerations

When optimizing blackjack simulations:
- The main simulation loop is in `play_game()` and `play_game_batch()` in `cardsharp/blackjack/blackjack.py`
- Card dealing happens through the `Shoe` class in `cardsharp/common/shoe.py`
- Strategy lookups occur in `cardsharp/blackjack/strategy.py`
- State management overhead in the state transition system
- Current performance: ~22,000 games/second in simulation mode (single-threaded)
- The default simulator uses multiprocessing to achieve ~350,000 games/second on multi-core systems

**IMPORTANT**: When optimizing performance, never compromise accuracy. See `docs/optimization_principles.md` for guidelines. A fast but inaccurate simulation is worthless.

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for core components (cards, decks, game logic)
- Integration tests for game engines and APIs
- Event cleanup tests to prevent memory leaks
- Async tests using pytest-asyncio
- Test isolation: Each test module has its own pytest.ini configuration

### Type Checking with Pyrefly

The project uses Pyrefly for fast type checking:

```bash
# Type check a specific file
uv run pyrefly check cardsharp/blackjack/blackjack.py

# Type check the entire project
uv run pyrefly check .

# Check a code snippet
uv run pyrefly snippet "def foo(x: int) -> str: return x"

# Initialize pyrefly config (already done)
uv run pyrefly init

# Automatically add type annotations
uv run pyrefly autotype cardsharp/blackjack/strategy.py
```

Pyrefly configuration is in `pyrefly.toml` at the project root.
