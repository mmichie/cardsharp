This module contains classes to represent a hand of cards in a card game.

It includes an abstract base class `AbstractHand`, and a concrete implementation `Hand`.
Each hand can have multiple cards, and provides methods for adding and removing cards.

Classes:

AbstractHand: An abstract base class for a hand of cards.
Hand: A concrete implementation of a hand of cards.
