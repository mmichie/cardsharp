"""
This module defines the `Suit`, `Rank`, and `Card` classes, which are used to represent playing cards.

- `Suit`: An enum representing the four suits of a standard deck of playing
cards: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades.

- `Rank`: An enum representing the thirteen ranks of a standard deck of playing
cards: Two through Ten, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. It also includes a Joker
rank.

- `Card`: A class representing a playing card. A card has a suit and a
rank. The `Card` class also provides methods for comparing cards and for
converting cards to strings for display.

This module is part of the `cardsharp` package, a framework for creating and playing card games.
