"""
This module provides the `Player` and `Dealer` classes for a game of Blackjack.

The `Player` class represents a player in the game. It maintains the state of the player's current hand,
the amount of money the player has, the player's current bet, and whether the player's turn is done. The
`Player` class also provides methods for the player to perform various actions, like hitting, standing,
splitting, and doubling down.

The `Dealer` class represents the dealer in the game. It is a subclass of `Player`, but with its own
logic for deciding whether to hit or stand.

Exceptions:
    - `InsufficientFundsError`: Raised when a player does not have enough money to perform an action.
    - `InvalidActionError`: Raised when a player attempts to perform an action that is not currently valid.

This module is part of the `cardsharp` package, a framework for creating and playing card games.
