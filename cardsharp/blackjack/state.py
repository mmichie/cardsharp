"""
This module provides an asynchronous game state management system for a
Blackjack game. It uses the state design pattern to manage the various game
states and transitions between them. The game progresses through various states:
WaitingForPlayersState, PlacingBetsState, DealingState, OfferInsuranceState,
PlayersTurnState, DealersTurnState, and EndRoundState.

Classes:

GameState: An abstract base class for game states.
WaitingForPlayersState: The game state while the game is waiting for players to join.
PlacingBetsState: The game state where players are placing their bets.
DealingState: The game state where the dealer is dealing the cards.
OfferInsuranceState: The game state where insurance is offered if the dealer has an Ace.
PlayersTurnState: The game state where it's the players' turn to play.
DealersTurnState: The game state where it's the dealer's turn to play.
EndRoundState: The game state where the round is ending.
The handle method in each game state class is responsible for performing the
actions required in that state, notifying the interface, and transitioning to
the next state. Each game state class also overrides the str method to return
the state name.
