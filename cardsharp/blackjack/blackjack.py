"""
This module is used to execute a game of Blackjack.

It can be used to play a game in different modes:
- Interactive console mode, where the user interacts with the game via the console.
- Simulation mode, where the game runs automatically.
- Logging mode, where game output is logged to a specified file.

To run the game in different modes, specific command line arguments are used.
For example, `--console` runs the game in interactive console mode,
`--simulate` runs the game in simulation mode and `--log_file` followed by a filename runs the game in logging mode.
